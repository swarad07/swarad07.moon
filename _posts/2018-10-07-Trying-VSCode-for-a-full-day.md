Hello world! Lets get straight to the point, for quite a while now I have been flirting with VSCode aside from my usual IDE which I have been using for more many years now (Only if my IDE could talk, I am pretty sure he would not approve of this affair). If I remember correctly I had downloaded VS Code the first day it was available. The idea of a good free "IDE" has always been something that has intrigued me.

If you must know, I one of those who has clear definations for an IDE and an editor, that will be a separate post. For large part of my initial career I have used Eclipse, I remember people using Notepad++ at that time, but notepad as a everyday code editor never landed right in my mind. But code editors have improved massively since then, Sublime Text, Atom are doing pretty well.

This is just to let you know that I have done this many times but probably the first time I am sharing what I have found when switching to something else as my daily code editor.

More to follow....
