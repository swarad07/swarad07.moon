Howdy! Another post from the PUBG series :smiley:.

Raking in PUBG Mobile is what matches you with other players, this ensures a consistent difficulty level for everyone in the match. A majority of players I know often reach Gold, Platinum & Diamond levels and find it difficult to progress further. You can certainly grind yourself to a higher rank, but if you plan your game properly you can get to higher ranks without playing very passive (hiding), without the need to invest long hours.

As I stated in my [earlier post](https://swarad07.github.io/PUBG-Mobile-10-Tips-To-Improve-your-game/), PUBG Mobile is a very layered game, you need to be good at many aspects than just aiming to master it. The thing that hinders most players is bad tactical decisions in higher levels. If you dont consistently finish top 10-15 at higher levels, you get negative rank which will hurt a lot.

## The most obvious plan ever (which never works!)

The obvious stragy most players think that is going to work but never does is to hide. They move from zone to zone and hide and avoid any egagement. This might well work for you but the odds on you getting better by playing like this are very low. This approach will easily take you to around Platinum, maybe early Daimond, but because you have no practice in engaging and fragging you will loose everytime in higher levels when 1-1 with a enemy. This strategy becomes counter productive and all ranking points you have earned by hiding you will loose in one match if you die early. So yah, dont be a scared mouse!

## Early Game & Best Routes.

Every player will figure out what guns he likes best, they will also figure out loot spots that they like best and have confidence to engage anybody else who lands there. Because of the random plan path you cant gaurantee you will get your loot spot everytime, in this situations there are two things you should do.

1) Vehicle Spawn points.

The most obvious solution to this problem is to land not at a loot location but rather at a point where you know there will be a vehcile. This requires map knowledge to know exact spots on the roads, in a garage, on the shore whre you will find a vehicle. You get into that vehicle and rush to your fav loot spot.

2) Alternative Loot spots.

While 1 is good, it might be sometimes risky. There is a chance someone else also has the same plan as you and gets to the vehicle first and runs you down with the car. Or you managed to get in the car, but someone kills you because you are going past them and they have a gun.

A safe bet in such cases is to land at another locations that work for you.

If you notice the above map, there are good locations scattered all around, you just need to find a backup for early game loot spot, preferrably something that is opposite side of your fav spot so it can be covered in the plan path.

My fav spot is "South Georgepool". So I often have the following algorithm running in my mind,

1. Land at South Georgepool. (50% of the time manage to do this.)
2. Get to South Georgepool by car. (20% of the time do this.)
   1. Find car between Pochinki and Farm hills
   2. Find car between Quarry and Primorsk
   3. Find car between School & Yasnaya
   4. Find car between Severny and Yasnaya
3. Land at Shelter (probably, 1 in every 10 games)
4. Land at Farm (Have not done this for a while now.)
5. Land at Gatka buildings, ones which are near Everest. (Never, unless my internet lags or game crashes and I cant do any of the above.)

As you can see I am trying my best to get to my favorite spot, if I cant I try to find a car from one of the four roads which I know are pretty deserted in early game and no is about to kill me.

Worst case scenarios, I have a alternate locations (white circles locations) Farm, Gatka buildings which I used to frequent often when I initially started playing so I know them pretty well.

## Startegy starts - Phase 1.

![speed](/assets/img/speed.png)

You need to know the circle speeds & damage they do. Refer this handy [reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6odhok/circle_breakdown_times_damage_travel_time_and_tips/), it lists down all the cirlces, their speeds, the damage they do and their time. Also remember circle moves faster on the bigger side.

The gist is that if you have a vehicle with you, first two circles are nothing to be scared about even if you are in blue zone, as long as you have enough meds and boosts you can easily stay in fighting shape till you get to safe zone for circle 3. Which more often than not, gives you a good ~5-7 min of initial loot time.

By this time you have done some looting and based on what you have you can decide how you want to play the game, if you have your best loot, you can be more aggressive if not you should plan on killing few players to get their loot.

In Phaes 1, the goal is to get loot that enables you to fight anyone that is occupying a building you want or has loot that you want.

## Phase 2 - Smooth is Slow, Slow is fast.

From here on we are just going to assume, you are not hiding in a corner (you are better than that!).

The Phase 2 is after circle 2 and start of Circle 3, from here on players have looted their spots, most bad players and bots are dead so it is important to start playing a percentage game.

As described in my previous post, PUBG is a game of hitpoints. Say you have a level 3 helmet and vest, someone is trying to kill you with a Kar98, but you dont know from where. You can show your head a bit longer and try to spot him, knowing that his best shot is not going to kill you, at the same time doing this with a level 1 helmet is suicide. So knowledge about guns will help here, once you spot him you can decide how to engage him.

If you have a long range weapon you can try to engage at a distance.

On the other hand if you dont have a long range weapon or a better gun, you are playing to other person's advantage. You need to take a step back and allow them to close you so you can engage them in a way that plays to strength of your guns.

Lay a trap and make your enemy do exactly what you want. TPP peak is a very good advanatge to have in such scenarios. Use your nades, smokes, mollis to do something your enemey was not planning on seeing.

## Phase 3 - Top 20 - Last man standing!

You can continue Phase 2, till you reach top 20. Top 20 is a very arbitary point in game planning becuase, it can happen anytime. Sometimes there will be 10 people in final circle and sometimes by 3 circle only 30 people are left.

At this point, it is safe to assume 20 best people are left on the server. Worst case scenario you need to kill 19, best case scenario you need to kill 1. But after this point it is dog eat dog world.

Ration your loot, ensure you are at full health and full boost before every engagement.

Dont show your location, if stealth is important anywhere it is now, if you show yourself 19 dogs are ready to kill you.

Have a vehicle handy, helps you to have cover as well as have a quick exit.

Play on the edges, this way you can be sure no one is coming from back. If you go in the center of zone you are literally the centre of all engagement.

If you do this 3 phases well, you will find you are more often than not finishing in top 10 if not winning that chiken dinner. Ranking will look irrelevant and something easy to manage.

## My more than 2 cents.

1) Try to land at your fav loot spot, it takes away suprises and gaurantees you the best loot that works for you every game.
2) Be ruthless in the initial game, mark your territory and dont allow anyone to share your fav loot spot. Get a gun and run after them, even if it is a shotgun.
3) Always have a vehicle with you, unless you know it will give your position away.
4) Try to follow a route that works for you, rest all will fall in place.
5) Ration your loot, no need of using those boosts if you know you are just going to sit in one place for the next 2 mins.
6) In the last circles take any advantage you get.
7) Try and master atleast one gun whcih you can use long range in a consistent manner.
8) Not all battles can be won, surrender a battle to win the war.
9) Smokes are your best friend, they create a distraction allowing you to hide/take cover/change angle, all without letting your enemy know what you are doing.
10) Dont carry more than you need, while full back pack doesnt make you heavy, it does take more time to loot anybody else later. As you will first have to empty and the pick up, which takes more time.
11) TPP peak is God like, learn to use it so you can see what other person can't.
12) High IQ plays,
    1)  If 2 people are killing each other, dont spoil their party, let someone win and then kill them while they were stupidly celebrating their kill.
    2)  Never approach a air drop directly without a smoke or a car to cover you. Best is to sit somewhere they cant see you and kill everyone that is trying to loot, then you go and loot everything. Don't be a Cindi Chor, be someone who owns them.
    3) Throw a nade or stun granade inside a building, this will make your enemy temporarily deaf and wont know when you are already inside and killing them.

Cheers!
